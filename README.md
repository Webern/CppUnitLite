"CppUnitLite has a funny story behind it. Michael Feathers, the original author of CppUnit, got fed up with the complexity of CppUnit and how it didn’t fit everyone’s needs, so we wrote the ultra-light weight framework CppUnitLite. It is as light on the features as it is on complexity and size, but his philosophy was to let people customize it to deal with whatever they need." -Noel http://gamesfromwithin.com/author/noel
